# Weather-DashBoard

User Story:

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

# Application:

This is a simple weather application that the user will be able to use at anytime and anywhere. Just go in and type and your city of choice and the weather dashboard will give the current weather today and the weather for the next 5 days. This is very handy if you are planning to travel. So be sure to use this before your departure. You can also look at past searches as well.

Hopefully I will be able to do more work on it in the future as I progress in my coding journey.
