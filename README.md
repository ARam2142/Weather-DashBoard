# Weather-DashBoard

User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

Application
______________________________________
This is a simple weather application that the user will be able to use at anytime and anywhere. Just go in and type and your city of choice and the weather dashboard will give the current weather today and the weather for the next 5 days. This is very handy if you are planning to travel. So be sure to use this before your departure. You can also look at past searches as well.

OutCome
_________________________________________
This was a very fun app to make. However it did come with alot of roadblocks. This is just part of the learning experience. I have put alot of time and effort into making this application come to life. I am proud of the work i have done. Hopefully i will be able to do more work on it in the future as i progress in my coding journey.
